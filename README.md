# CHATBOT

**Drona AI** is a RAG Chatbot built using FastAPI, Gemini-2.5-flash, and ChromaDb for storing vector embeddings. The chatbot is designed for a alumni portal where the user, that is the students, can ask any doubts related to the alumni data of their college or any doubts related to their preparation. The response will be generated on the basis of the pdf file that has been given as the input data. 

Doubts asked regarding companies which none of the alumni have interviewed for, the AI simply won't answer. Meaning, it never hallucinates and responds only from existing alumni data.
